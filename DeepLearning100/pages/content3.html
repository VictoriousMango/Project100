      <h2>Introduction to Perceptron</h2>
      <p>Perceptron is the fundamental building block of artificial neural networks and essential for understanding deep learning.</p>
      <p>The video will cover the basics of perceptrons, including training methods, limitations, and transitions to multi-layer perceptrons.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Understanding Perceptron</h2>
      <p>A perceptron is defined as an algorithm used for supervised machine learning, akin to linear regression and logistic regression.</p>
      <p>It can be viewed as both an algorithm and a mathematical model, specifically a mathematical function.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Structure and Functioning of Perceptron</h2>
      <p>The basic structure consists of input values (<code>x1, x2</code>), weights, and a bias.</p>
      <p>A summation block combines the weighted inputs to produce a value (<code>z</code>), which is then passed through an activation function.</p>
      <p>The activation function converts <code>z</code> into an output, typically binary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Training and Prediction</h2>
      <p>Two stages are involved: training to determine the weights and bias, and prediction to classify new data.</p>
      <p>The training process involves adjusting weights based on known outputs to minimize error.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Input Variations</h2>
      <p>The perceptron can accommodate multiple input features expanding beyond just two.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Comparison with Biological Neurons</h2>
      <p>The architecture of perceptrons is inspired by biological neurons, showing similarities but also significant differences in complexity.</p>
      <p>While a perceptron processes inputs and produces outputs in a straightforward manner, biological neurons exhibit much more complex electrochemical reactions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Geometric Intuition of Perceptron</h2>
      <p>Perceptrons create distinct regions for classifying data, which can be visually understood in two-dimensional space.</p>
      <p>The line drawn by a perceptron represents a decision boundary that separates different classes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Limitations of Perceptron</h2>
      <p>Perceptrons can only classify linearly separable data; they fail with non-linear datasets, limiting their effectiveness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Practical Implementation</h2>
      <p>A practical example applies the perceptron to a dataset of students to predict placement outcomes based on CGPA and other factors.</p>
      <p>The demonstration includes model training and visualization of decision boundaries.</p>
