      <h2>Introduction to Deep Learning</h2>
      <p>This video serves as an introduction to Deep Learning, emphasizing its significance in the field of development
        and artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>It aims to clarify what Deep Learning is, its origins, and how it differs from Machine Learning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Definition of Deep Learning</h2>
      <p>Deep Learning is described as a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning inspired by the
        human brain's structure.</p>
      <p>Two types of definitions for Deep Learning are given: a simple version and a more technical one, both aiding in
        better understanding.</p>
      <p>The technical definition mentions that Deep Learning uses artificial neural networks for representation
        learning, extracting higher-level features from data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Deep Learning requires significantly more data compared to Machine Learning, making it data-hungry.</li>
        <li>While Machine Learning can operate with less data, Deep Learning's performance and reliability increase
          linearly with more data.</li>
        <li>Hardware requirements differ: Machine Learning can run on simple CPUs, but Deep Learning typically requires
          powerful GPUs due to complex matrix calculations.</li>
        <li>The training time for Deep Learning models is generally much higher compared to Machine Learning models.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Neural Networks and Architecture</h2>
      <p>Deep Learning algorithms utilize neural networks, which mimic human brain functioning and are structured in
        layers to process input data.</p>
      <p>Different types of neural networks and architectures exist for various tasks, such as Convolutional Neural
        Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).</p>
      <p>Transfer learning is highlighted as a method to use pre-existing architectures, saving time in training for new
        problems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Reasons for the Popularity of Deep Learning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The rise of accessible large datasets, such as user-generated content on social media, has driven the need
          for Deep Learning.</li>
        <li>Advanced hardware developments have enabled faster computations, essential for Deep Learning algorithms.
        </li>
        <li>The emergence of user-friendly frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch has made it easier for practitioners
          to work with Deep Learning.</li>
        <li>Community efforts and ongoing research have fueled advancements in the field, promoting a culture of sharing
          and collaboration.</li>
      </ul>
