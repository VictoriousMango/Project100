      <h2>Aim</h2>
      <p>1. To set up an 850nm fiber optic analog link and observe the relationship between the input signal and the received signal.</p>
      <p>2. To measure the bandwidth of the link.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="apparatus">
      <h2>Apparatus</h2>
      <p>The equipment and materials required for the experiment are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>OFT Kit (Optical Fiber Trainer Kit)</li>
        <li>Oscilloscope</li>
        <li>Function Generator</li>
        <li>1m and 3m Optical Fiber</li>
        <li>Connecting Cables</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="section" id="theory">
      <h2>Theory</h2>
      <p>A fiber optic analog link is used to transmit analog signals, such as audio or video, through an optical fiber. The analog input signal is converted to an optical signal using a transmitter and sent through the fiber. At the receiver end, the optical signal is converted back into an electrical signal for analysis or playback.</p>
      <p>The bandwidth of the link determines the range of frequencies it can transmit without significant loss or distortion. The efficiency and quality of the link depend on factors such as fiber length, wavelength, and system components.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="procedure">
      <h2>Procedure</h2>
      <p>Follow these steps to perform the experiment:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Set up the OFT Kit, ensuring the transmitter and receiver modules are properly connected.</li>
        <li>Connect the function generator to the transmitter module and set it to generate a sinusoidal signal of a specific frequency.</li>
        <li>Use the 1m optical fiber to connect the transmitter and receiver modules.</li>
        <li>Connect the output of the receiver module to an oscilloscope to observe the received signal.</li>
        <li>Compare the input and output signals to analyze the relationship between them.</li>
        <li>Repeat the experiment using the 3m optical fiber and observe the differences in signal quality and amplitude.</li>
        <li>To measure the bandwidth, vary the frequency of the input signal and note the frequency at which the output signal starts to attenuate significantly.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="observations">
      <h2>Observations</h2>
      <p>Record the following observations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Amplitude and quality of the received signal for 1m and 3m fibers.</li>
        <li>Frequency at which the output signal attenuates significantly (bandwidth measurement).</li>
        <li>Relationship between input and output signal waveforms.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion/Results</h2>
      <p>The experiment successfully demonstrated the setup of a fiber optic analog link and its ability to transmit analog signals over varying distances. The bandwidth of the link was measured, and the impact of fiber length on signal quality was observed.</p>
