      <h2>Aim</h2>
      <p>To set up a quantum cryptography experiment to study key distribution and detect an eavesdropper using classical light.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="apparatus">
      <h2>Apparatus</h2>
      <p>The equipment and materials required for the experiment are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Polarizing Beam Splitter</li>
        <li>Polarizer</li>
        <li>Single Photon Source</li>
        <li>Detector</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="theory">
      <h2>Theory</h2>
      <p>Quantum cryptography is a technique that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to secure communication. It relies on the properties of photons, such as polarization, to encode and distribute cryptographic keys. Any attempt to intercept the key introduces detectable disturbances, ensuring the security of the communication.</p>
      <p>In this experiment, classical light is used to simulate quantum cryptographic principles. Key distribution and eavesdropping detection are studied using a setup of polarizers and detectors.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="procedure">
      <h2>Procedure</h2>
      <p>Follow these steps to perform the experiment:</p>

      <h3>Part 1: Key Distribution</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Set up the single photon source (or classical light source) to emit light beams through a polarizing beam splitter.</li>
        <li>Use polarizers to encode polarization angles for key distribution: 0째, 45째, 90째, and 135째.</li>
        <li>Direct the encoded light beams to a receiver equipped with a polarizing beam splitter and detectors.</li>
        <li>Record the received polarization angles and verify the key distribution between sender (Alice) and receiver (Bob).</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Part 2: Detecting an Eavesdropper</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Introduce an intermediate polarizing beam splitter to simulate an eavesdropper (Eve) attempting to intercept the key.</li>
        <li>Measure the disturbances in polarization at the receiver's end caused by Eve's presence.</li>
        <li>Analyze the discrepancies between the distributed keys to detect eavesdropping.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="observations">
      <h2>Observations</h2>
      <p>Record the following observations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Key distribution efficiency (percentage of correctly received keys).</li>
        <li>Impact of eavesdropping on the polarization states of the light.</li>
        <li>Differences in key accuracy with and without the presence of an eavesdropper.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion/Results</h2>
      <p>The experiment demonstrated the principles of quantum cryptography using classical light. Successful key distribution was achieved, and eavesdropping was detected through the disturbances introduced in the polarization states. This highlights the robustness of quantum cryptography in securing communication.</p>
