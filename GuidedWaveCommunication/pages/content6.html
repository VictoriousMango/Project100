      <h2>Theory</h2>
      <p>The Talbot effect is a near-field diffraction phenomenon where a periodic structure, such as a diffraction grating, creates self-imaging at regular distances along the propagation direction. It was first discovered by Henry Fox Talbot in 1836.</p>
      <p>When a coherent light wave illuminates a periodic grating, the wave diffracts and reconstructs its intensity distribution at specific distances called Talbot planes, and the regular distance is called the Talbot length, and the repeated images are called self-images or Talbot images. The periodic pattern is repeated at these planes without the need for a lens.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, at half the Talbot length, a self-image also occurs, but phase-shifted by half a period (the physical meaning of this is that it is laterally shifted by half the width of the grating period). This effect is widely used in optics, imaging, and lithography.</p>
      <p>The optical Talbot effect for monochromatic light is shown as a "Talbot carpet" in Figure 1. At the bottom of the figure, the light can be seen diffracting through a grating, and this pattern is reproduced at the top of the picture (one Talbot length away from the grating). At regular fractions of the Talbot length, the sub-images form.</p>

      <h2>Procedure</h2>
      <p>Step-by-step instructions for the experiment:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Laser Source Setup:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Use a He-Ne laser (632.8 nm) as the coherent light source.</li>
            <li>Ensure the laser output is stable and well-aligned.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Beam Expansion and Collimation:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Place a microscope objective (MO) after the laser to expand the beam.</li>
            <li>Use a lens to convert the diverging beam into a collimated beam.</li>
            <li>Adjust the lens position to achieve proper collimation.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Grating Placement:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Position the unknown grating perpendicular to the collimated beam.</li>
            <li>Ensure the grating is correctly aligned to avoid angular misalignment.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Capturing the Talbot Image:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Place a CCD camera at different distances along the propagation axis.</li>
            <li>Observe and record multiple self-images of the grating.</li>
            <li>Adjust the camera position to capture a clear Talbot pattern.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Measurement of Talbot Distance:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Identify the distance between the grating and the first self-image plane.</li>
            <li>Measure the Talbot distance (Z<sub>T</sub>) from the CCD images.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Calculation of Grating Period:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the Talbot formula: <span class="math">Z<sub>T</sub> = P<sup>2</sup> / λ</span></li>
            <li>Solve for the grating period: <span class="math">P = √(Z<sub>T</sub> λ)</span></li>
            <li>Substitute the measured Talbot distance Z<sub>T</sub> and He-Ne laser wavelength λ = 632.8 nm to find P.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Analysis and Verification:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Compare the calculated grating period with standard values.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Observations</h2>
      <p>When the collimated laser beam passed through the unknown grating, multiple self-images appeared at specific distances along the propagation axis.</p>
      <p>Clear self-images of the grating were observed at certain distances, confirming the Talbot effect.</p>
      <p>The observations shown below illustrate the calculation of grating period in lines per millimetre for two different gratings and comparison of error percentage calculation with actual period of grating.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The estimated period of gratings was calculated to be 10.101 lines/mm and 7.873 lines/mm, where the standard values of the gratings are 10 lines/mm and 8 lines/mm, respectively. The percentage errors in the calculations were 1.01% and 1.58%, indicating a close match with the actual values and confirming the validity of the Talbot effect for determining grating periods.</p>
